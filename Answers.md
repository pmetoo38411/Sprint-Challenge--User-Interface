    *//If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
I would describe it as a short form for identifing parts that compose a page. So for example when you write in micorsoft would you might have to identify a header, you would select a header and it would look different the rest of your story or whatever you may be writting, it may have differnt font, larger text size. All the things make it differnt from your body copy. In HTML ypu have to divide your code in a similar way by identifing it and the beggning an end of what you want to be in that identified area, for example <h> header </h>. So that is all semantic HTML literally semantics and will identifying and seperating areas that you intent to share similar charactersitics.

    *//Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;. Lets see block uses basic tag like <p> or <div> whereas inline would be a part of the block itself like and <img> is part of a defined <p> section.

    *//What are the 4 areas of the box model? content, margin, padding, border.

    *//While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center? um confused about the question but I will say x and y because flex-direction changes the direction like column , north  & south, the row is east to west. I think it is all based on an x and y axis.

    *//What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? git commit -m "your message"
